        This function will take the color_range_dict and the player bounding boxes and generate a thresholded image where the color
        of interest remains and all other pixels are black. It will compute a ratio of color pixels versus total pixels in the 
        bounding box and put the ratios in a list. The argmax of this list will be the team color of the current player.

        Parameters:
            player_region: (np.ndarray) - Omage region of a player, defined by a bounding box.
            color_range_dict: (dict) - A dictionary of the colors (keys) and their BGR ranges (values).

            masked_images: (dict) - This is a dict of the thresholded images as the values, and color of interest as
